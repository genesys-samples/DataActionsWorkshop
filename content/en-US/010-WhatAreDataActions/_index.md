## Getting Started With Data Actions

Welcome to our Data Actions workshop where we will not only cover what Data Actions are, but also how they work at the root level. As we move through this workshop, you will gain an understanding of what data actions are comprised of, how they are used in day to day use cases, and how to configure your very own Data Action from scratch. We expect the course will take 2 hours to complete in total.

We will start at the beginning to understand the basics of Data Actions and APIs. To begin this journey, we will start with:

  * Define Data Actions
  * Understand Data Action components
