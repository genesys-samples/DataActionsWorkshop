## Configuration


Now that we have covered the basics of what a Data Action is and how API calls are structured, we will work torwards the configuration components of an API (Data Action). In the next steps we will be working hands-on in building your data action integration within your Genesys Cloud org, authenticating the integration, and creating a schema to which your Data Action will call against. 

In this section we will -
  * Find and execute a call from the Genesys Cloud Developer Center
  * Use JSON path tools to parse the responses for the data we're looking for
  * Create an OAuth Client and Install the Data Actions Integration
  * Use the Data Action constructor to build our first API Call
